Resources
=========

MVCSS
-------------
[MVCSS][MVCSS] [Modular View CSS] is the base of this fork. It is Sass-based an can be applied to all different kinds of applications.


MVCSS Library
-------------

We maintain a [Library][library] of additional Helpers, Components, and documents that you may find useful in building your applications. These modules aren't needed as commonly as the ones included with MVCSS by default, but our team has found plenty of use for them between projects.


Influences
----------

We’re always on the lookout for new approaches and better means of abstraction. Here are some great resources and examples for writing better CSS that we’ve worked to incorporate into our thinking.
